 # üß† Machine Learning Hierarchy: Questions and Answers

## üìå General Machine Learning Overview

### **Q1: What is Machine Learning and what are its main categories?**
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. The three main categories are:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

## üéØ SUPERVISED LEARNING

### **Q2: What is Supervised Learning and when is it used?**
Supervised Learning uses labeled training data (input-output pairs) to learn a mapping function. It's used when you have historical data with known outcomes and want to predict future outcomes. The two main types are Classification and Regression.
